Question 13 [TF] with 3 marks - part (c): The graph of f : [0, π/2] → R, f(x) = √sin(2x) is shown below. On the same set of axes, sketch the graph of the derivative function f'.

Question 16 [TA] with 2 marks - Question 4: In a cattle ranch, an agriculturist monitors two identical cows, A and B, over 20 months to study the effects of food deprivation. Cow A receives a normal diet throughout, while Cow B is placed on a restricted diet for the first 10 months and then resumes a normal diet. The weight gains of the cows over time are plotted below. Both cows have gained 400 kg after 20 months. Cow A's weight gain, A(t) in kg after t months is modelled by A : [0,20] → R, A(t) = p - p/(t+q) where p and q are positive constants. Cow B's weight gain, B(t) in kg after t months is modelled by B(t) = {B₁(t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10, B₂(t) for 10 < t ≤ 20} where B₁(t) and B₂(t) are linear transformations of the graph of A(t). The graphs of B₁(t) and B₂(t) are joined at the point (10,200). Part (a): Describe a sequence of transformations that maps the graph of A(t) to the graph of B₂(t).\

\
Question 18 [TA] with 1 mark - Question 12: A pharmaceutical company is running two independent clinical trials – one in Sydney and another in Melbourne. Let S be the event that the Sydney trial is successful and M be the event that the Melbourne trial is successful. Suppose that P(S) = 0.7 and P(M) = 0.6. Given that at least one of the two trials is successful, what is the probability that only the Melbourne trial is successful, correct to four decimal places? A. 0.1080, B. 0.2045, C. 0.3061, D. 0.4286\
